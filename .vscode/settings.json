{
    "liveServer.settings.port": 5501
}

// What it is

// Folder: .vscode → stores VS Code project-specific settings.

// File: settings.json → contains configuration for this project.

// Your current content:

// {
//     "liveServer.settings.port": 5501
// }


// Means:

// The Live Server extension will run your project on port 5501 instead of the default port.

// This allows you to preview your website locally in a browser and see changes instantly when you save files.

// What you should do

// Nothing is required.

// Keep the folder and file — it’s project-specific and safe to commit to GitHub if you like.

// You can ignore it if you want, but it’s helpful because it saves your Live Server settings for this project.

// You don’t have to change anything unless you want a different port.

// Tip: Many developers do include .vscode in their repos, but some prefer to add it to .gitignore so personal VS Code settings aren’t shared. For a portfolio project, it’s okay to leave it.
